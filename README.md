9) LFSkipList: A wrapper for java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet for comparison purpose.

This is an Apache Ant managed project. To build, run ant in the project directory. For an optimized run, following command containing flags can be used: java -d64 -Xms4G -Xmx8G -cp ./dist/ConcurrentSet.jar se.chalmers.dcs.bapic.concurrentset.test.BenchMark (Assuming that the application is run on a 64-bit environment).

Further, to bind the jvm threads on a NUMA machine, numactl --physcpubind=<nodes> can be used. For further info on numactl see its manpages.
